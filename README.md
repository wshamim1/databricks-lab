## Suggested order

Start with the platform overview, then move into governance, then infrastructure, and finish with notebook and job orchestration patterns.

## Topics covered

### Databricks at a glance

Databricks is a unified analytics platform built around the lakehouse model. It combines data engineering, analytics, machine learning, governance, and orchestration in one environment.

### Delta Lake and lakehouse

Delta Lake is the table format and transaction layer that makes lakehouse-style data management practical. The lakehouse architecture combines low-cost cloud storage with warehouse-style reliability, performance features, and governance.

### Medallion architecture

The medallion guide and notebook show how raw records move from bronze to silver to gold, with examples of ingestion metadata, data quality filtering, deduplication, and business-level aggregates.

### Observability and troubleshooting

The observability guide and notebook show how to inspect run metrics, row-count changes, rejected records, freshness, and common failure patterns across Databricks jobs and tables.

### External integrations

The external integrations guide and examples show how Databricks fits into Airflow, Azure Data Factory, GitHub Actions, AWS Step Functions, and dbt-driven delivery patterns.

### Real-world ingestion

The real-world ingestion guide and notebook show practical source patterns such as Kafka events, IoT sensor telemetry, file-based landing, API extraction, and CDC-style ingestion into bronze, silver, and gold layers.

The dedicated Kafka and IoT notebooks go deeper into end-to-end event ingestion, device heartbeat checks, and anomaly candidate generation.

### Governance distinctions

The governance tutorials explain the difference between Hive metastore, catalogs, and Unity Catalog so older Spark or Hive terminology does not get mixed up with the modern Databricks governance model.

### Key terms

- Lakehouse: data architecture that combines data lake flexibility with data warehouse management features
- Workspace: the user-facing collaboration area for notebooks, jobs, dashboards, repos, and assets
- Compute: the processing layer used to run notebooks, jobs, SQL, and machine learning workloads
- Unity Catalog: the governance layer for data and AI assets across workspaces
- Catalog: a namespace inside Unity Catalog, used to organize schemas and tables

### Quick reference

The glossary page provides short definitions for the main Databricks platform, storage, governance, SQL, and streaming terms used across these tutorials.

### Interview prep

The FAQ page collects common Databricks questions and short, direct answers for revision, onboarding, and interview preparation.

### Automation

The APIs and SDK guide shows how to create and manage jobs and compute programmatically with Databricks REST APIs and the Python SDK.

### Orchestration choices

The scheduler comparison and scheduler architecture pages explain how Databricks Jobs compare with Airflow, Azure Data Factory, and Step Functions, plus how internal and external schedulers fit together.

## Common role mapping

- Data engineers build ingestion and transformation pipelines
- Analysts query curated data and build dashboards
- Data scientists explore data and train models
- Platform teams manage governance, security, compute policies, and cost controls

## How to use this repo

- Read the markdown guides for concepts and terminology
- Open the notebooks for working examples of Spark code, Delta operations, medallion layering, observability checks, real-world ingestion patterns, Kafka pipelines, IoT monitoring patterns, Unity Catalog usage, Databricks SQL, streaming patterns, machine learning workflows, API automation, scheduler design, job orchestration, and notebook patterns
- Use the scripts in `scripts/` as starting points for Databricks REST API and Python SDK automation
- Use the scripts in `scripts/` as starting points for Databricks REST API, Python SDK, external scheduler automation, and Kafka or Event Hubs ingestion trigger examples
- Use the examples in `integrations/` as starting points for Airflow, Azure Data Factory, GitHub Actions, and Step Functions integration patterns
- Use the examples in `integrations/dbt/` as a starting point for dbt on Databricks model projects
- Extend the examples with your own datasets, Delta tables, or job definitions
