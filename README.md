# Databricks Tutorials

This repository is a compact learning path for Databricks fundamentals.

## What you will learn

- What Databricks is and where it fits in a modern data platform
- What Delta Lake is and why it matters for reliable analytics
- How lakehouse architecture combines data lake and warehouse patterns
- How Unity Catalog differs from a catalog and why that distinction matters
- How workspaces, compute, and the Databricks architecture fit together
- How notebooks, jobs, and schedulers are used in day-to-day delivery
- Which Spark parameters matter most in practice
- How to write simple Databricks notebook code with PySpark

## Suggested order

Start with the platform overview, then move into governance, then infrastructure, and finish with notebook and job orchestration patterns.

## Topics covered

### Databricks at a glance

Databricks is a unified analytics platform built around the lakehouse model. It combines data engineering, analytics, machine learning, governance, and orchestration in one environment.

### Delta Lake and lakehouse

Delta Lake is the table format and transaction layer that makes lakehouse-style data management practical. The lakehouse architecture combines low-cost cloud storage with warehouse-style reliability, performance features, and governance.

### Key terms

- Lakehouse: data architecture that combines data lake flexibility with data warehouse management features
- Workspace: the user-facing collaboration area for notebooks, jobs, dashboards, repos, and assets
- Compute: the processing layer used to run notebooks, jobs, SQL, and machine learning workloads
- Unity Catalog: the governance layer for data and AI assets across workspaces
- Catalog: a namespace inside Unity Catalog, used to organize schemas and tables

### Quick reference

The glossary page provides short definitions for the main Databricks platform, storage, governance, SQL, and streaming terms used across these tutorials.

## Common role mapping

- Data engineers build ingestion and transformation pipelines
- Analysts query curated data and build dashboards
- Data scientists explore data and train models
- Platform teams manage governance, security, compute policies, and cost controls

## How to use this repo

- Read the markdown guides for concepts and terminology
- Open the notebooks for working examples of Spark code, Delta operations, Unity Catalog usage, Databricks SQL, streaming patterns, job orchestration, and notebook patterns
- Extend the examples with your own datasets, Delta tables, or job definitions
